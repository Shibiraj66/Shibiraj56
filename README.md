Singly Linked List in C

This repository contains a basic implementation of a Singly Linked List in C. Singly linked lists are a type of data structure that consist of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

Features

Node Insertion: Add a node at the beginning, end, or in a specific position in the list.

Node Deletion: Remove a node from the list.
